# hello-world
brand new and taking first steps to learning

Hello all, 

I am 28 and tired of the repetive cycle of work that is general labor
I want to learn how to become a web developer so that I may have a useful skill to fall back on.
I will soon be married to my now fiance, and we have three loving and annoying cats.
